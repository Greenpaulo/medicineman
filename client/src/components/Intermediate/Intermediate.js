          <h3>A CHANGE IN THINKING</h3>

          <p>Despite this current monopolisation of our healthcare system and scientific worldview, there are many scientists who are coming back to the knowledge of our ancestors, that the universe is not just material.</p>

          <p>Heaven (2001) believes that in recent years the population of the western world are now beginning to see that science, especially in the area of quantum physics, is coming to the same view of the world as shamanic healers in traditional societies - that everything in the universe is energy.  According to Heaven (2001) the shamanic view, which is anything up to 400,000 years old, is that matter and energy are one and everything is connected through the energetic matrix, the great web of life.  According to Langley (2008) the Navajo people of North America believe that “we and the land are one...the same substance, the same being, and cannot be separated”.  They apply this to all living things, and further this by saying “the earth is part of the universe, so, you see, all things in the universe are linked together for all time.”</p>

          <p>The famous demonstration of this concept was made by Albert Einstein with his equation E=mc2, which shows that energy and matter are dual expressions of the same universal substance (Heaven, 2001).  This universal substance being a primal energy or vibration (Gerber, 2001).  Gerber (2001) argues that if the entire universe and everything in it is made of energy then the human body itself must consist entirely of energy, vibrating at different speeds or frequencies.  Far from being just a physical body the human body is actually made up of a network of complex energy fields that interconnect with the cellular/physical system (Gerber, 2001).  Vibrational medicine can be thought of as attempting to heal the human body by manipulating the basic vibrational level of substance (Gerber, 2001)
          </p>

          <p>In the latter half of the 20th century scientific thinking seemed to enter the beginning of a paradigm shift (Talbot, 1996).  A paradigm shift is defined as a change in the basic assumptions within the current ruling theory of science (Kuhn, 1996).  Michael Talbot in his book ‘The Holographic Universe’ describes a new way of viewing the universe which has emerged from scientific research (Talbot, 1996).  This new evidence comes from experiments performed by physicists such as David Bohm, at The University of London, Alain Aspect, at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Optics, and also neuroscientist Karl Pribram at Stanford University (Talbot, 1996).</p>

          <p>Through observation of subatomic particles these physicists saw that some of the particles seemed to be communicating instantaneously and no matter the distance between the particles, their movements would be synchronised.  The particles seemed to be communicating to each other faster than the speed of light over seemingly immense distances to each other.  However according to Einstein the speed of light is a constant which cannot be superseded.  Eventually they came to the conclusion that the two particles were not communicating at all but were actually the same particle (Talbot, 1996).</p>

          <p>From findings such as these, Bohm and Pribram came up with a new model of the universe as a giant floating hologram largely formed by our own consciousness and our lives as a projection within this hologram (Talbot, 1996).  Gerber (2001) points out that the property of a hologram is that every piece contains the whole, and takes this point further by applying this to the physical body, where we can see that every cell should contain the information to replicate the whole body – and it does in the form of DNA (Gerber, 2001).  This backs up the holographic view of the universe and provides us with a new scientific model to understand the energetic structure of the universe as well as the multidimensional nature of human beings (Gerber, 2001).</p>

          <h3>HUMAN MULTIDIMENSIONAL ANATOMY</h3>

          <img src="/images/human_energy_body.gif" alt="The Human Energy Body" />

          <p>Dale (2009) argues that traditional societies perceive a more direct relationship between energy and the physical body than is the case in western societies.  A study of ninety seven different cultures across the world found that each had its own name for life energy fields (White & Krippner, 1977 cited in Brennan, 1993).  To take an example, according to Villoldo (2001) the Q’ero people, the last remaining Inca, see that all human beings possess a luminous energy field that surrounds our physical body.  To the Q’ero shamans it appears as a torus shaped translucent, multi-coloured orb surrounding you to the width of your outstretched arms with a narrow axis or tunnel in the centre.  This mimics the Earth’s magnetic field with the North and South Pole representing the head and feet respectively.  Interestingly the Q’ero have also identified what appear to be streams of golden light that flow through the body just above the skin which are argued to correspond with the Chinese meridian system (Villoldo, 2001).</p>

          <p>Until recently this way of seeing the human body was dismissed by western society and still is in orthodox medicine, due to a seeming lack of scientific evidence proving the existence of what is now being referred to as “Human Multidimensional Anatomy” (Gerber, 2001). However Gerber (2001) argues that scientific evidence has existed for over sixty years but is yet to be acknowledged by western mainstream medical practice (for reasons we shall get to in the Advanced section). </p>

          <p>Gerber bases this argument on his review of evidence provided by experimental work. Between the years of 1919-1958, Burr (1972) a professor of neuroanatomy, conducted several experiments into the electromagnetic potential of living plants and animals.  In a series of experiments studying the energy fields around salamanders he discovered that all salamanders possess an energy field roughly shaped like the adult salamander and in trying to find the origin of this field he found that it originated in the unfertilized egg.  After more studies on other plants and animals he concluded that all living things possess an electrodynamic field.  This field acts as a growth template which exists before the physical body and on which the physical body is formed, and is responsible for each organism’s development.  He named these “fields of life” or “L-fields” (Burr, 1972).</p>

          <img src="/images/kirlian_leaf.jpg" alt="Kirlian photograph of a leaf" />

          <p>Further research into these bioenergetic growth templates was conducted by Russian researchers in 1966 using an electrophotography technique developed by Semyon Kirlian (Gerber, 2001).  The researchers discovered an interesting phenomenon called the “Phantom Leaf Effect”.   In their experiment they photographed the energy field of a leaf using the electrographic process and then cut off the upper third of the leaf and destroyed it. They then took another photograph of the remaining leaf and discovered that the energy field of the cut leaf was still whole.  The amputated portion of the leaf still appears in the photograph even though it had been physically destroyed (Gerber, 2001) (See image below) </p>

          <p>Brennan (1988) was an ex-NASA scientist, who investigated human energy fields over a twenty year period.  She argues that the work using Kirlian photography supports the arguments of Burr, that the energy field could not arise from the physical, rather the physical arises from the energetic.</p>

          <p>The growth template discovered by Dr Burr seems to be well known in metaphysical literature as the blueprint of the physical body and is named the “etheric body” (Brennan, 1988).  The etheric body is said to be one of many energy bodies that make up the full human form and is the closest subtle body to the physical body (Dale, 2009).  According to Johnson (2000) it hugs the physical body like a second skin and it is the interface between the physical body and the rest of the subtle energy system.  The Inca shamans also experience this to be the blueprint for the anatomy of the physical body (Villoldo, 2001).</p>

          {/* <img src="/images/etheric_body.gif" alt="The Etheric Body" /> */}

          <p>Brennan (1988) has come to the conclusion, after twenty years of research, that everything that is created in the physical world must be first formed in the structural levels of the energy fields.  Therefore all physical disease in the human body must first exist as a disease or distortion of the energy fields surrounding and interpenetrating the physical form.  Brennan (1988) continues to point out that if we wish to change the state of the human body or any organ within it, from an unhealthy state to a healthy one, then we must work with the underlying energies that are the foundation for our bodies. </p>

          <h3>THE CHAKRAS</h3>

          <img id="chakras_front" src="/images/chakras_front.jpg" alt="The Chakras" />

          <p>An example of a traditional belief system which has been investigated is the concept of chakras.  The research and scientific discovery of the chakras is another finding that is starting to bring scientific thinking more in-line with the traditional world.  According to Dale (2009), chakras are the major energy centres in the body located at the main branching of the nervous system.  They are said to resemble swirling vortices of energy, hence the name “chakra” comes from the Sanskrit word meaning “wheels” (Arewa, 2001).  It is worth noting here, that even though the Hindu people are recognised as the discoverers of chakras, chakra systems are to be found in traditional societies in all corners of the globe, the Mayans, Cherokee and Inca being examples (Dale, 2009).  The chakras are said to take in subtle energies of high frequency and translate it into a useable form within the human body, which occurs as nervous and glandular function (Gerber, 2001).  Each of the seven major chakras is anatomically associated with a major endocrine gland and major nerve plexus.  Two chains of nerve bundles have been found on either side of the spine correlating to the location of chakras (Pert, 1999). </p>
            
          <p>Scientific research into the existence of these energy centres has been conducted by Dr Valerie Hunt, a professor at the University of California.  For the past twenty years Hunt has measured bioelectrical energy variations at various points of the human body, using an electromyograph (used for measuring the electrical output of muscles).  From this research Hunt discovered that the physical body emanated regular, high frequency sinusoidal electrical oscillations in areas of skin corresponding to the positions of the chakras.  Muscle frequency is usually a maximum of 225 cycles per second (cps) but these emanations went up to 1600cps, higher than anything previously found radiating from the physical body (Hunt, 1996).  </p>

          <p>In another experiment Hunt collaborated with a well-known trained psychic observer, Rosalyn Bruyere.  Bruyere was asked to observe changes in the subject’s subtle energetic field while at the same time the chakras were being monitored, electronically.  Hunt found that Bruyere’s observations of colour change in the “aura” of the subjects correlated exactly with the readings from the electromyograph.  The colours that Bruyere observed were matched by the recorded wave pattern associated with that colour.  During the experiments the immediate feedback from the electromyography was kept out of view of Bruyere at all times (Hunt, 1996).</p>

          <h3>THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN HEALTH</h3>

          <p>The chakras have also been associated with the emotions.  Sky (2003) tells us that emotions are actually energy-in-motion (e-motion).  Western medicine, especially Endocrinologists have already acknowledged that particular emotional patterns relate to specific types of glandular dysfunction such as thyroid dysfunction (Gerber, 2001).  Gerber (2001) furthers this concept to say that that what western medicine has been missing is the fact that the major endocrine glands and their hormonal activity are actually dependent upon the energizing influence of their associated chakras.  He argues that emotional imbalances are actually due to abnormal patterns of energy flow (emotion as energy-in-motion) in the subtle bodies and chakras (Gerber, 2001).</p>

          <p>Candace Pert Ph.D is a neuroscientist who has spent nearly forty years studying neuropeptides or what she calls the ‘molecules of emotion’ (Pert, 1999).  Pert’s research seems to provide the missing scientific evidence for the link between mind and body, and how our emotions are actually the number one factor in health or disease.  Pert is a mainstream neuroscientist who started her work in 1972 searching for the opiate receptor in the brain.  From this discovery she continued her research into neuropeptides and their receptors.  Peptides are small chains of amino acids, and this category includes all hormones and neurotransmitters.</p>

          <p>In the 1980’s neuropeptides were thought to be the chemicals secreted by the brain (only) that were known to mediate mood and behaviour e.g. endorphins, dopamine.  Through her continued research in the then, new area of psychoneuroimmunology, Pert discovered that these emotion-affecting peptides or ‘information substances’ and their receptors were not only to be found in the brain but were actually found in cells all over the body including the immune system and the endocrine system.  These cells and their systems were actually shown to be in communication with each other by the release of neuropeptides and the receipt of them through their cell surface receptors (Pert, 1999). </p>

          <p>This had a major impact on how cutting-edge science viewed the role of emotions in the health of the organism.  For example, Pert discovered that on the surface of monocytes, a key cell in the immune system, were receptors for all the neuropeptides found in the brain e.g. endorphins, serotonin.  These ‘molecules of emotion’ appeared to be actually controlling the migration and routing of the monocytes and were therefore pivotal to the health of the human organism.  Pert argues that this finding demonstrated the scientific connection behind stress and a weakened immune system (Pert, 1999).</p>

          <p>In Pert’s view, the discovery of neuropeptides was a major breakthrough towards the understanding that the body and mind are one.  If the mind under the old scientific model is defined by brain-cell communication through neuropeptides and their receptors, then this can now be naturally extended to include the entire body.  Since neuropeptides and their receptors are in the body then science can now say that the mind is the body, or there exists one “body-mind”.  The ‘molecules of emotion’ literally run the physiology and communicate from one cell to another, integrating the systems (Pert, 1999)</p>

          <p>Pert believes that emotional expression is always linked to the flow of peptides in the body which seems to be the physical counterpart of the subtle energy-in-motion.  Pert says the emotions and peptides are in two way communication.  An example of emotions affecting peptides is the action of blushing - the thought and emotion comes first and then the peptides follow, causing the blood vessels in the face to expand.  The release of endorphins in the body causing pain relief and euphoria is an example of peptides affecting emotions (Pert, 1999).</p>

          <p>From this viewpoint, expression of all the emotions is a healthy way to live as it lets the subtle energy and its physical counterpart, the peptides, flow freely around the network of communication in the body, maintaining homeostasis.  It can be thus argued that it is the chronic suppression of emotions that energetically results in a disturbance of the flow of subtle energy, through the chakras, into the body.  The physical result is an insufficient flow of peptides and a disturbance of function at the cellular level, setting up a weakened condition of the organism that can lead to disease (Brennan, 1988; Pert, 1999).</p>

          <p>Kissen and Eysenck (1962) carried out research into personality differences in male lung cancer patients.  The research looked into the connection between lung cancer, cigarette smoking and the repression of emotion.  They discovered that smokers who were unable to express emotion were five times as likely to develop cancer and that the greater the repression, the less amount of cigarette smoking required to be at the risk of cancer (Kissen and Eysenck, 1962).</p>

          <p>Another similar study was carried out in the former Yugoslavian industrial town of Crvenka over a ten year period.  In this study Grossarth-Maticek et al. (1985) utilized what they called rationality and antiemotionality (R/A), a factor related to the suppression of aggression.  The researchers used a questionnaire of 109 questions.  It was found that in the group of smokers who answered the 11 questions relating to a high level of suppression of aggression in the affirmative, the level of cancer was 40 times higher.  Conversely, it was found that no smokers had any incidence of cancer unless they had R/A scores of 10 or 11.  The researchers suggested that smoking alone is not sufficient to cause cancer and suppression of emotions is an important factor in disease (Grossarth-Maticek et al., 1985).</p>

          <p>Further research found that trauma and blockage of emotional information can be stored indefinitely at the cellular level (Pert, 1999).  An example of this is the proposed link between early childhood emotional trauma and subsequent cancer.  Harris (2006) has compiled evidence which argues that trauma before the age of seven is an important factor in the aetiology of cancer.  Dale (2009) argues that almost every other culture but ours recognises the role played by some kind of emotional energy release in healing.</p>
