In the 1980s The Mobius of Society in Santa Monica, California, ran a number of trials of an experiment using nine different healers. These unrelated individuals transmitted healing 'vibrations' into sealed bottles of water, which were then sent to a laboratory for spectrographic analysis. In this double-blind study, there was a consistency in the degree of change in the spatial relationship of the water molecules.
