For several years he worked investigating the role of bacteriology in chronic disease. His researches led him to recognise that there were clear personality types that related to the various patterns of ill health, irrespective of the physical symptoms being presented by the patient. Working with vaccine therapy and later with homeopathic remedies, he moved towards the discovery of flower remedies. These he felt could help to harmonise the emotional imbalances that he came to see as the real causes of physical illness.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-1 br-10\">\r\n        <h4>Discovery of the essences</h4>\r\n        <p>By 1930 he was prepared to give up his successful medical practice in order to search for the plants and trees that came to be known as The Twelve Healers & Other Remedies. Each flower was found to embody the positive and harmonising force for a negative emotional state, be it fear, resentment or despair. In order to transfer this healing force to a patient, Bach prepared essences from the flowers. This essence, diluted to some extent, could then be taken as a medicine. He found that as the negative moods changed so the person would return towards health. Dr Bach explained the healing properties of the remedies in terms of a philosophy of life that saw a person as much more than the outward physical body that is treated in conventional medicine. Illness, he suggested, was a message from our inner being calling for a change in our way of living and our mental outlook. The primary purpose of the flower essences is to help us to change and bring us back to a genuinely happy experience of life. They have been in use throughout the world in the years since Bach’s death in 1936.

We had already been drawn to them and were getting great results when Ann asked us if we would like to make them available to customers in the UK for her. We are delighted to be doing so. So many people who come into contact with the Indigo gem essences are captivated by their lightness and strength. These characteristics also allow children to open themselves to their healing qualities and Indigo Essences have been especially formulated to help the new children stay balanced and fairly sane through these times of intense change.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>These 'Indigo' children can have a very difficult time integrating with others, both at home and in school and many of them have very strong energy and definite views about life which can be challenging both for the children and for their care givers. Ann says 'One of the biggest problems for children is not being listened to and understood.' A lot of adults are very bad communicators and don't know how to really listen to children which in turn leads to the children resorting to more extreme behaviours to try and get their point across. Listening to your child is key to growing together harmoniously as a family. If you are having a stressful time at home a combination of good communication and essences will help to move energy very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Of course there is a child in all of us and the Indigo Essences can be used by anyone who recognises that their own child needs some healing and support.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Ann says 'Indigo Essences are a kind of first aid kit for feelings, they are like good vibes in a bottle. They help balance your energy and when you are 'well balanced' it's much easier to heal yourself.'</p>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-1 mt-1 mb-2 br-10\">\r\n        <h3>Why Indigo?</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>People are talking about the coming of new children who are here to help us make a huge evolutionary leap into another way of being. Many of these children are called Indigo Children because they have the colour indigo as the primary colour in their aura. However, we believe that all children, indeed all people, on the planet are now playing their part in this transition.The colour indigo is often described as the colour of the night sky the moment before the dawn of a new day. This is how we see Indigo - as a moment in time, not just as a label for specific individuals.

Subtle, non-physical aspects, such as the Vital Force of flowers can be imprinted on water. In this way, the positive “memory signature” of a particular essence creates a vibrational shift back to a state of harmonious balance.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The body has an innate intelligence to self-correct imbalanced or negative states, known as homeostasis in Western medicine. The essences, on a frequency level, facilitate this self-healing body wisdom by recalibrating the body’s energy systems - the Meridians and Chakras.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"bg-primary mt-1 mb-1 py-2 px-1 br-10\">\r\n        <h3>What are the ingredients?</h3>\r\n        \r\n        <p>Pacific Essences® do NOT contain any physical elements of the plant, animal, gem or crystal sources, instead their individual “frequency” is captured and stored in water. Alcohol or Brandy is used as a preservative with a dilution of 50% spring water, 50% Brandy (20% alcohol by volume).</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"bg-secondary mt-1 mb-2 py-2 px-1 br-5\">\r\n        <h3>How are they made?</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>The flower is placed into a crystal bowl filled with pure spring water. The bowl is kept in sunlight for a short while, up to a couple of hours, in order to transfer the vibrational energy of the plant to the water. In the case of a living creature like Whale or Dolphin, the water that the animal has passed through is collected. No animal is ever harmed in this process. When possible, we don’t harm the plant when making the essences. Rather than clipping a flower off, we prefer to dip the flower or submerge it for a short time in the spring water. The plant remains whole and living.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <h3>How are Essences used?</h3>\r\n\r\n      <p>Typically taken orally, essences can be used directly from the stock bottle or prepared into a dosage bottle. The general rule for making a dosage bottle is to fill a clean, glass dropper bottle with a dilution of 25% alcohol/brandy (a preservative) and 75% water. Choose the purest water available. Add two or more drops from the stock essence bottle and shake gently. Label. Ready for use. Drops from the dosage bottle can be taken directly or in a glass of water.

The most widely-used remedies of this type are flower essences and many homeopathics. Other vibrational remedies include animal essences, gem elixirs, and starlight elixirs.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Vibrational remedies are characterized by their energetic nature -- each remedy contains the energetic imprint of the animal/flower/gem/star/etc from which it is derived.</p>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"bg-secondary mt-1 mb-2 py-2 px-1 br-10\">\r\n        <h3>How are Wild Earth Animal Essences made?</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>No animals are captured or harmed to develop these products. The essences are made during a ceremonial process in a wilderness area of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. This ceremonial process includes attuning with and invoking the spirit of the animal involved. The resulting liquid contains the energy of the animal but does not contain any animal parts.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>My deep connections with wild animals, with the Earth, and with Native Americans have all served to inspire the development of the very personal ceremony that I use to create the animal essences.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Stan Grof, one of the pioneers of the transpersonal psychology movement over the past 40 years, says something very wise that seems fitting to share:</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\"In a yet unexplained way each human being contains the information about the entire universe or all of existence, has potential experiential access to all its parts, and in a sense is the whole cosmic network, as much as he or she is just an infinitesimal part of it, a separate and insignificant biological entity.\"</p>\r\n\r\n        <i>-- Dr. Stan Grof, Modern Consciousness Research and Human Survival, in REVISION, Vol 8 no 1, summer-fall 1985.</i>\r\n\r\n        <p>It is this innate ability that each of us has, to connect with all aspects of creation, that allows me to do the work I do, in combination with my own personal experiences of the animals and the work I have done on my own personal healing journey.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The prime ingredient involved in developing these remedies is the power of Intent. This is the creative building block of creation, and setting a clear intention to connect with a specific animal in the making of an essence is the fundamental first step.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The ceremony itself is quite simple; an observer looking at the forest clearing where I work would not see a great deal going on. That's because the process of attuning to the spirit of the animal involved happens in a very quiet, meditative, and internal way. I first collect a small bowl of water from the stream nearbyand place it at the center of the clearing. I then step beyond the edge of the clearing, and I begin the ceremony by walking in a large circle -- approximately 100 meters in diameter -- around the clearing. I meditate as I walk in a series of ever smaller circles, until after about 15 minutes I find myself at the center of the clearing beside the bowl of water. Throughout the meditation, I connect and pray to the animal I am invoking, telling it that I am here to serve in this way if it wishes to share its gifts with humankind. By the time I reach the center of the circle I have touched a place inside me where the animal and I are one. At this time the I experience the energy of the animal finding its newest abode in the bowl of water at the center of the circle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>During the meditation walk I may hold a small feather or hair sample to bring me into deeper physical contact with the energy of the animal. However, this sample is not placed in the bowl and is used solely for helping me attune to the energy of the animal. (The samples have been gathered without harming any animals.)</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>When I feel that all is complete, I proceed to walk out in reverse from the way I came in, this time through a series of ever larger circles until I return to the edge of the largest circle where I began. As I walk these circles in reverse on the way out, I slowly feel my everyday state of consciousness and mind returning to me, and I am deeply grateful to have shared in the beauty of this experience.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>When I began developing these essences, I was amazed to see that they really work, and part of me is still in awe of the fact that remedies created by me in this way are truly effective. Yet feedback from around the world continues to affirm that these remedies are valuable to many people in their emotional and spiritual journeys, and for that I am grateful to be a part.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>When one takes an animal essence, it is the consciousness of the animal that interacts with our own consciousness. This interaction occurs in a gentle, supportive way.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <h3>What else is in the essences?</h3>\r\n\r\n      <p>Along with the energy of the animal, each essence contains distilled water and brandy (40%) as a vibrational preservative. Without the brandy, the vibration would quickly dissipate. (If you are alcohol sensitive, drops may be added to a cup of boiling water and the alcohol will quickly evaporate.)</p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>How much and how often do I take the essences?</h3>\r\n\r\n      <p>There are many ways to take the essences, and you can experiment and do what feels right to you. We recommend taking 5-7 drops, 3-4 times per day, but not with food. Of course, you may take them more or less frequently if you wish. With vibrational remedies, it is best to take them more frequently rather than taking more drops at any given time. Taking more drops is not harmful, just wasteful. It is fine to take two essences at a time if you wish.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Vibrational remedies may be taken in a variety of ways. You may take them orally, by diluting them in a small glass of water, or they may be taken directly under your tongue. They are also just as effective by adding them to a warm bath. The effects of the remedies are heightened by quiet reflection and meditation upon the animal's qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WEAE\r\n","import uuid from

Before this time of pharmaceutical drugs and germ theory, doctors would use medicinal herbs to treat their patients, and this usage of plant medicine has a history of at least 5000 years.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>There is a lot more to healing than is currently practiced in our healthcare system. At this present time our healthcare system in the West has excellent emergency and critical care but falls short with the treatment of chronic conditions. This inadequacy stems from a very narrow understanding of the human body and the nature of reality itself. Orthodox medicine views the body as a machine. Symptoms are “managed” and old worn our parts are replaced with no thought given to the actual cause or root of the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Science dictates healthcare, and the scientific understanding of the world filters into our healthcare system. Anything that can’t be measured of physically seen is cast aside because of a “lack of scientific evidence”. Therefore we have a healthcare system that is not holistic and doesn’t understand the true impact of the mind and spirit on health and disease.</p> \r\n\r\n            <p>Pharmaceutical companies also a have huge impact on our current healthcare systems, so much so that they have infiltrated the education and practice of doctors, which has become merely an exercise in matching the symptoms to the drug, with no thought or concern for the individuality of the patient, or any mental or emotional stress they maybe facing.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Real healing goes way beyond the physical. Instead of using synthetic made man chemical drugs, we can instead choose to use the same medicine as our ancestors, the medicines of nature. Plant medicines work in an entirely different way than orthodox medicines, they are alive and contain intelligent life-force or spirit that teach us to heal our minds and bodies through direct realisation of how we have created our disease and how we can heal it.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"beginner-section-2\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-secondary py-2 px-2 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>WHAT ARE FLOWER ESSENCES?</h3> \r\n            <p>The use of flowers for healing dates back over three thousand years. According to ancient records the Egyptians collected the dew from flowers to treat emotional imbalances. The Australian aboriginals also have a long history of treating illness by floating flowers on water for some time and then drinking the water. The earliest written use of flower essences in Europe dates back to the twelfth century where Abbess Hildegard Von Bingen was also collecting the dew from flowers to treat patients.  She would instruct the nuns to lay muslin cloth over the flowers at night and in the morning the cloth would be rung out to collect the dew.  In the sixteenth century the famous Swiss physician, Paracelsus, was also treating his patients’ emotional and physical ailments with the dew from flowers.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>However during the eighteenth and nineteenth century a change in the medical paradigm to a more mechanistic view of the human body, backed by such thinkers as Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin, led to the fading away of the traditional knowledge of flower essences and other preparations.  In the western world, flower essences stayed in relative obscurity for a while until the 1930’s when a British physician, Dr Edward Bach, brought them back into use. Dr Bach worked as a bacteriologist at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and it was there that he soon became interested more in the patients themselves than their diseases. Talking to patients at their bedside he realised that the real cause of their illnesses was emotional. The body was a mirror reflecting the thoughts in the mind. Bach came to the conclusion that it was the sufferer themselves, the person, who needed the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Following his intuition, Dr Bach left London in 1930 to explore the English countryside in a hope to find plant medicines that could treat his patient’s emotional problems. This led to the discovery of the Bach Flower Remedies which are probably the most famous flower essences in the world.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"beginner-section-3\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-2\">\r\n            <h3>HOW DO THEY WORK?</h3>\r\n            <p>Flowers are the most evolved part of the plant kingdom and carry positive, life affirming patterns of conscious energy.<sup>3</sup> A flower essence is a vibrational medicine that contains the high-frequency subtle energies of the plant it was made from and these energies are said to be able to act on the subtle-energy bodies of the human being. By acting on the human energy body, it is believed that the vibrational energies of the flowers can assist in realigning the emotional patterns of dysfunction.<sup>4</sup> Bach’s understanding was that by correcting these emotional factors, the patient would then be assisted in increasing their physical and mental vitality and therefore be aided in the resolution of their physical disease.<sup>5</sup> At a deeper level flower essences are an intelligent healing energy and a catalyst for evolution in human consciousness and that they help to identify mental and emotional qualities that need to be awakened or strengthened to stimulate spiritual growth.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>However as the physiological effects of flower essences on the energy system are difficult to measure with our current, popular, medical technology then the sceptics would say that there is little hard evidence for using flower essences to treat physical disease. Methods to measure vibrational medicine do exist however, in the form of radionics, Kirlian photography and electroacupunture but are not currently accepted in our medical paradigm.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Since the death of Dr Bach in 1936 many flower essence producers around the world have continued his work and contributed to the re-introduction of flower essences into modern medicine.  One of the first to do this was the Flower Essence Society (FES) established by Richard Katz in 1979.  The FES are based in California and are a group of flower essence practitioners who introduced a new group of essences made from flowers indigenous to the USA.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>A few years later more producers appeared, preparing flower essences from the indigenous flowers in their countries.  In 1984 Steven Johnson set up the Alaskan Flower Essence Project and in 1986 the Australian Bush Flower Essences were founded.  These new essences expanded on the Bach essences and addressed issues surrounding sexuality, intimacy, creativity, communication and spirituality. Areas that were seemingly missing from the application of the Bach flower essences.  Because of the times, Ian White, the founder of the Australian Bush Flower Essences, suggests that today’s society and needs are very different than that of sixty years ago and these newer essences are more in line with the problems we face today.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"beginner-section-4\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-2 mt-1 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>WHAT ARE GEM / ENVIRONMENTAL / ANIMAL / SEA ESSENCES?</h3>\r\n            <p>Everything in the universe is energy.

The willingness to trust others is built into our DNA. Working together has always been key to the survival of our species. Having faith in one another is in the best interest of both the individual and the collective. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>As a child we trust our parents, we trust our teachers, we trust authority. We quickly learn then when it comes to medicine then our doctor is the person to trust. At a young age we learn to give our power of looking after our own health away to authority. Throughout our entire lives most people never question whether the doctor is right. Whether the doctor actually understands medicine, and how the doctor came across this “knowledge”. We blindly trust the doctor and our current healthcare model.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>However, the truth is that pretty much all of what the doctor learned about medicine is wrong. The doctor is just another human that went through the “education system” and then chose to go to “medical school”, and the majority blindly trusted what they were taught <i>without question</i>. Their understanding of medicine is not experiential, it’s a learned system based on the teaching of others. To begin to understand how we got our current healthcare model, we need to understand who decides what model is taught.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>A massive change in Western healthcare education came after the “Flexner Report” in 1910. This was the beginning of the end for traditional medicine and the start of a massive takeover by John D. Rockefeller and the oil industry.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>This is excerpt of an article written by Rev. Dennis Shipman<sup>1</sup> :</p>\r\n\r\n            <div id=\"flexner-article\" className=\"px-2 py-2 bg-secondary br-10 mb-3\">\r\n              <h4 className=\"mb-2\">The Flexner Report of 1910 – The Rockefeller-Carnegie Big Pharma Scam</h4>\r\n              \r\n              <p>John Davidson Rockefeller (1839-1937) was an American oil industry business magnate, industrialist, and philanthropist. His net worth is estimated at USD $409 Billion in 2018 dollars, adjusted for inflation. He is widely considered the wealthiest American of all time, and the richest person in modern history.</p>\r\n              \r\n              <p>In the 1870’s, John D Rockefeller became friends with Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist. Carnegie was a steel industry tycoon in the late 19th century – and became one of the richest people in America and the world. His net worth is estimated at USD $372 Billion in 2014 dollars, adjusted for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/apothecary.jpg\" alt=\"1900's Apothecary\" />\r\n\r\n              <p>In the late 1800’s, early 1900’s, there existed different kinds of natural medicine schools: homeopathic, osteopathy, naturopathic, eclectic herbal medicine schools, diet, midwives, steam baths, and so forth. It was all there, both allopathic and naturopathic medicine, co-existing together. There was not just one way. Rockefeller and Carnegie changed all that. They were interested in establishing only one way. They knew they could patent the drugs, but they couldn’t patent natural medicine or any source coming from nature. To achieve their goal, they knew they had to eliminate the competition: natural medicine (homeopathy, herbal therapies, naturopathy, etc.).They captured the medical education system and created a monopoly by eliminating all the competition that threatened their brand of medical education which was to teach patented pharmaceutical drugs as the only way to cure illness. The Flexner Report of 1910 was a setup. Abraham Flexner were hired and paid by Rockefeller and Carnegie (through the AMA) to publish a report to denounce and eliminate the competition. And, it worked.</p>\r\n              \r\n              <p>Abraham Flexner (1866-1959) was not a physician or scientist or medical educator. He was a former school teacher, expert on educational practices, had specialized training in psychology, held a bachelor of arts degree, and was founder and operator of a for-profit college-prep school in Louisville, Kentucky. Flexner published a critical assessment of the state of the American educational system in 1908 titled “The American College: A Criticism.” His work attracted the attention of Henry Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation, and a staunch advocate of medical school reform. Flexner’s book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and soon thereafter, Flexner joined the research staff at the Carnegie Foundation in 1908. Flexner was selected by Pritchett for his scholarly reputation, evaluation skills, critical thinking, writing ability and his dislike for traditional education.</p>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/flexner-report.png\" id=\"flexner\" alt=\"Front cover of the flexner report\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n              <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) was founded in 1847. In 1910, with financial support from Rockefeller and Carnegie, the AMA funded the Flexner Report which evaluated the various medical colleges. The Flexner Report was a book-length study entitled \"Medical education in the United States and Canada\", written by Abraham Flexner, published and given to the U.S. Congress in 1910 under the endorsement and financial support of the Carnegie Foundation. Congress acted on the report's conclusions and made them law. The report was slanted in favor of the outcome that Rockefeller and Carnegie envisioned. It stated that most medical schools were not teaching sound medicine, which in the eyes of Rockefeller and Carnegie meant that the natural health colleges were not pushing enough chemical drugs manufactured by Carnegie and Rockefeller. The AMA made it their self-appointed job to target and shut down the larger respected homeopathic colleges that did not comply with the Flexner Report. Carnegie and Rockefeller began to immediately shower hundreds of millions of dollars through their tax-exempt foundations on these medical schools that were teaching drug-intensive medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>To ensure the medical schools swung completely in the direction of teaching and pushing pharmaceutical drugs, the donors (Rockefeller and Carnegie) made it a condition to appoint one of their staff to the school’s board of directors in order for the school to receive the grants and donations. Rockefeller and Carnegie justified this by saying that they wanted to make sure the school was spending their money in the right way. If the school wanted the money, it would comply with the request. So Rockefeller and Carnegie began to load up the schools board of directors with their staff members who were on the payroll of the donors. In return for the grants and donations, Rockefeller and Carnegie required the schools to continue teaching course material that was exclusively pharmaceutical drug-oriented, with no emphasis on natural medicine. Once that was in place, the pendulum swung in favor of the Rockefeller-Carnegie Big Pharma Scam, and it has remained that way ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>By 1925, over 10,000 herbalists were out of business. By 1940, over 1,500 chiropractors had been prosecuted for practicing \"quackery\". The 22 homeopathic medical schools that flourished in the 1900’s dwindled down to just two by 1923. By 1950, all the schools teaching homeopathy were closed. If a physician did not graduate and receive an M.D. degree from a “Flexner approved” medical school, he or she could not find a job anywhere. This is why today, medical doctors lean heavily towards and favor synthetic drug therapy, and know little about the natural healing properties of nutrition and natural healing cures found in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n              <img src=\"/images/prescription-drugs.jpg\" id=\"prescription-drugs\" alt=\"Prescription drugs\" />\r\n\r\n              <p>As a result of the Flexner Report, medical research got the green light onto the never-ending treadmill of searching for newer and so-called better drugs to treat illness. Although its toxicity is deadly, and in some cases patients die, chemotherapy became the new treatment for cancer patients in the 1940’s.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>The entire medical field has been skewed in the direction of pharmaceutical drugs. These drugs can be patented and produced at great profits for the big pharma capitalistic bigwigs wearing horse blinders who have no regard for any healing properties that nature can provide. Yet, there is a growing awareness among many allopathic doctors that believe the promise of healing and cures are found in nature’s herbs and plants and trees and seeds. And, probably it was meant to be that way. Today, there is a robust resurgence and an ever-growing industry of natural medicine remedies and therapies throughout the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>When all is said and done, after all the analysis has been scrutinized and after all the history has been revealed, it’s difficult not to come away with the realization that the medical profession is really like a house of prostitution for the pharmaceutical industry. And, most doctors have no idea that this is the case because they don’t understand the perverted history of Big Pharma.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <p>So our current medical model that is taught in all western medical schools was not the outcome of thousands of years of study into the human body and medicine. It was not the teaching of our ancestors passed down by medicine men from generation to generation. It was not even a collaboration of all the doctors of the time. It was the outcome of a book written by one man, Abraham Flexner, who was not even medically trained, funded by oil and steel tycoons.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>We can clearly see how it was a calculated takeover of the healthcare system by John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnagie, to create a new system based on the prescribing of patentable petrochemical drugs, and the creation of a pharmaceutical monopoly in order to accrue huge wealth and power to the detriment of the health of humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>It is this model of “health” that all our Western doctors are trained in.</p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-2\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-2 br-10 mb-2\">\r\n            <h3>WHY MODERN \"MEDICINE\" IS NOT MEDICINE</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>The healthcare model that came out of the Flexner Report was not a healing model. It was never designed to be. It doesn’t make “business” sense to heal customers. What Rockefeller and Carnagie wanted were lifelong customers so they built a medical model that perpetuated fear and only ever managed symptoms without ever getting to the root of the dis-ease. They knew they couldn’t patent nature, so they demonised all natural remedies, replaced them with petrochemical drugs, and created medical schools solely to train doctors to match these new drugs with symptoms. The medicine men, the old herbalists, were labelled “Quacks”. The result of this new system was patients who would never heal. They would only ever be “managing symptoms” with petrochemical drugs, and be kept in a chronic state of dis-ease for years. The average 65yr old in the US, is now on 6 different prescription drugs. Exactly what Rockefeller and Carnagie had envisioned. (We will look deeper into the intent behind this medical takeover and the suppression of health in the Advanced Section.)</p>\r\n\r\n            <p></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-3\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div  className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-2 br-10 mb-2\">\r\n            <h3>A CHANGE IN THINKING</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>Despite this current monopolisation of our healthcare system and scientific worldview, there are many scientists who are coming back to the knowledge of our ancestors, that the universe is not just material.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In recent years the population of the western world are now beginning to see that science, especially in the area of quantum physics, is coming to the same view of the world as shamanic healers in traditional societies - that everything in the universe is energy. The shamanic view, which is anything up to 400,000 years old, is that matter and energy are one and everything is connected through the energetic matrix, the great web of life.<sup>2</sup> The Navajo people of North America believe that “we and the land are one...the same substance, the same being, and cannot be separated”.  They apply this to all living things, and further this by saying “the earth is part of the universe, so, you see, all things in the universe are linked together for all time.”<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The famous demonstration of this concept was made by Albert Einstein with his equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, which shows that energy and matter are dual expressions of the same universal substance.<sup>2</sup>  This universal substance being a primal energy or vibration.  If the entire universe and everything in it is made of energy then the human body itself must consist entirely of energy, vibrating at different speeds or frequencies.  Far from being just a physical body the human body is actually made up of a network of complex energy fields that interconnect with the cellular/physical system.  Vibrational medicine can be thought of as attempting to heal the human body by manipulating the basic vibrational level of substance.<sup>4</sup>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In the latter half of the 20th century scientific thinking seemed to enter the beginning of a paradigm shift. A paradigm shift is defined as a change in the basic assumptions within the current ruling theory of science.<sup>5</sup>  Michael Talbot in his book ‘The Holographic Universe’ describes a new way of viewing the universe which has emerged from scientific research. This new evidence comes from experiments performed by physicists such as David Bohm, at The University of London, Alain Aspect, at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Optics, and also neuroscientist Karl Pribram at Stanford University.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Through observation of subatomic particles these physicists saw that some of the particles seemed to be communicating instantaneously and no matter the distance between the particles, their movements would be synchronised.  The particles seemed to be communicating to each other faster than the speed of light over seemingly immense distances to each other.  However according to Einstein the speed of light is a constant which cannot be superseded.  Eventually they came to the conclusion that the two particles were not communicating at all but were actually the same particle.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>From findings such as these, Bohm and Pribram came up with a new model of the universe as a giant floating hologram largely formed by our own consciousness and our lives as a projection within this hologram.<sup>6</sup>  Gerber (2001) points out that the property of a hologram is that every piece contains the whole, and takes this point further by applying this to the physical body, where we can see that every cell should contain the information to replicate the whole body – and it does in the form of DNA.  This backs up the holographic view of the universe and provides us with a new scientific model to understand the energetic structure of the universe as well as the multidimensional nature of human beings.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-4\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-secondary py-2 px-2 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>HUMAN MULTIDIMENSIONAL ANATOMY</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/human_energy_body.gif\" alt=\"The Human Energy Body\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>Traditional societies perceive a more direct relationship between energy and the physical body than is the case in western societies.<sup>7</sup>  A study of ninety seven different cultures across the world found that each had its own name for life energy fields.<sup>8</sup>  To take an example, the Q’ero people, the last remaining Inca, see that all human beings possess a luminous energy field that surrounds our physical body.  To the Q’ero shamans it appears as a torus shaped translucent, multi-coloured orb surrounding you to the width of your outstretched arms with a narrow axis or tunnel in the centre.  This mimics the Earth’s magnetic field with the North and South Pole representing the head and feet respectively.  Interestingly the Q’ero have also identified what appear to be streams of golden light that flow through the body just above the skin which are argued to correspond with the Chinese meridian system.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Until recently this way of seeing the human body was dismissed by western society and still is in orthodox medicine, due to a seeming lack of scientific evidence proving the existence of what is now being referred to as “Human Multidimensional Anatomy”. However that scientific evidence has existed for over sixty years but is yet to be acknowledged by western mainstream medical practice<sup>4</sup> (for reasons we shall get to in the Advanced section). </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Gerber bases this argument on his review of evidence provided by experimental work. Between the years of 1919-1958, Burr (1972) a professor of neuroanatomy, conducted several experiments into the electromagnetic potential of living plants and animals.  In a series of experiments studying the energy fields around salamanders he discovered that all salamanders possess an energy field roughly shaped like the adult salamander and in trying to find the origin of this field he found that it originated in the unfertilized egg.  After more studies on other plants and animals he concluded that all living things possess an electrodynamic field.  This field acts as a growth template which exists before the physical body and on which the physical body is formed, and is responsible for each organism’s development.  He named these “fields of life” or “L-fields”.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/kirlian_leaf.jpg\" alt=\"Kirlian photograph of a leaf\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>Further research into these bioenergetic growth templates was conducted by Russian researchers in 1966 using an electrophotography technique developed by Semyon Kirlian. The researchers discovered an interesting phenomenon called the “Phantom Leaf Effect”.   In their experiment they photographed the energy field of a leaf using the electrographic process and then cut off the upper third of the leaf and destroyed it. They then took another photograph of the remaining leaf and discovered that the energy field of the cut leaf was still whole.  The amputated portion of the leaf still appears in the photograph even though it had been physically destroyed. <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Barbara Brennan is an ex-NASA scientist, who investigated human energy fields over a twenty year period. She argues that the work using Kirlian photography supports the arguments of Burr, that the energy field could not arise from the physical, rather the physical arises from the energetic.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The growth template discovered by Dr Burr seems to be well known in metaphysical literature as the blueprint of the physical body and is named the “etheric body”.  The etheric body is said to be one of many energy bodies that make up the full human form and is the closest subtle body to the physical body.<sup>7</sup> It hugs the physical body like a second skin and it is the interface between the physical body and the rest of the subtle energy system. <sup>12</sup> The Inca shamans also experience this to be the blueprint for the anatomy of the physical body.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            {/* <img src=\"/images/etheric_body.gif\" alt=\"The Etheric Body\" /> */}\r\n\r\n            <p>Brennan has come to the conclusion, after twenty years of research, that everything that is created in the physical world must be first formed in the structural levels of the energy fields.  Therefore all physical disease in the human body must first exist as a disease or distortion of the energy fields surrounding and interpenetrating the physical form. Brennan continues to point out that if we wish to change the state of the human body or any organ within it, from an unhealthy state to a healthy one, then we must work with the underlying energies that are the foundation for our bodies.<sup>11</sup> </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-5\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"py-2\">\r\n            <h3>THE CHAKRAS</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img id=\"chakras_front\" src=\"/images/chakras_front.jpg\" alt=\"The Chakras\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>An example of a traditional belief system which has been investigated is the concept of chakras. The research and scientific discovery of the chakras is another finding that is starting to bring scientific thinking more in-line with the traditional world. Chakras are the major energy centres in the body located at the main branching of the nervous system.  They are said to resemble swirling vortices of energy, hence the name “chakra” comes from the Sanskrit word meaning “wheels”.<sup>13</sup> It is worth noting here, that even though the Hindu people are recognised as the discoverers of chakras, chakra systems are to be found in traditional societies in all corners of the globe, the Mayans, Cherokee and Inca being examples.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The chakras are said to take in subtle energies of high frequency and translate it into a useable form within the human body, which occurs as nervous and glandular function.<sup>4</sup> Each of the seven major chakras is anatomically associated with a major endocrine gland and major nerve plexus.  Two chains of nerve bundles have been found on either side of the spine correlating to the location of chakras.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n              \r\n            <p>Scientific research into the existence of these energy centres has been conducted by Dr Valerie Hunt, a professor at the University of California.  For the past twenty years Hunt has measured bioelectrical energy variations at various points of the human body, using an electromyograph (used for measuring the electrical output of muscles). From this research Hunt discovered that the physical body emanated regular, high frequency sinusoidal electrical oscillations in areas of skin corresponding to the positions of the chakras.  Muscle frequency is usually a maximum of 225 cycles per second (cps) but these emanations went up to 1600cps, higher than anything previously found radiating from the physical body.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In another experiment Hunt collaborated with a well-known trained psychic observer, Rosalyn Bruyere. Bruyere was asked to observe changes in the subject’s subtle energetic field while at the same time the chakras were being monitored, electronically. Hunt found that Bruyere’s observations of colour change in the “aura” of the subjects correlated exactly with the readings from the electromyograph. The colours that Bruyere observed were matched by the recorded wave pattern associated with that colour.  During the experiments the immediate feedback from the electromyography was kept out of view of Bruyere at all times.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            {/* <img src=\"/images/chakras_side.jpg\" alt=\"The Chakras - side view\" /> */}\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-6\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary px-2 py-2 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN HEALTH</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>The chakras have also been associated with the emotions. Emotions are actually energy-in-motion (e-motion).<sup>15</sup> Western medicine, especially Endocrinologists have already acknowledged that particular emotional patterns relate to specific types of glandular dysfunction such as thyroid dysfunction.  Gerber (2001) furthers this concept to say that that what western medicine has been missing is the fact that the major endocrine glands and their hormonal activity are actually dependent upon the energizing influence of their associated chakras.  He argues that emotional imbalances are actually due to abnormal patterns of energy flow (emotion as energy-in-motion) in the subtle bodies and chakras.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Candace Pert Ph.D is a neuroscientist who has spent nearly forty years studying neuropeptides or what she calls the ‘molecules of emotion’. Pert’s research seems to provide the missing scientific evidence for the link between mind and body, and how our emotions are actually the number one factor in health or disease.  Pert is a mainstream neuroscientist who started her work in 1972 searching for the opiate receptor in the brain.  From this discovery she continued her research into neuropeptides and their receptors.  Peptides are small chains of amino acids, and this category includes all hormones and neurotransmitters.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In the 1980’s neuropeptides were thought to be the chemicals secreted by the brain (only) that were known to mediate mood and behaviour e.g. endorphins, dopamine. Through her continued research in the then, new area of psychoneuroimmunology, Pert discovered that these emotion-affecting peptides or ‘information substances’ and their receptors were not only to be found in the brain but were actually found in cells all over the body including the immune system and the endocrine system.  These cells and their systems were actually shown to be in communication with each other by the release of neuropeptides and the receipt of them through their cell surface receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>This had a major impact on how cutting-edge science viewed the role of emotions in the health of the organism.  For example, Pert discovered that on the surface of monocytes, a key cell in the immune system, were receptors for all the neuropeptides found in the brain e.g. endorphins, serotonin.  These ‘molecules of emotion’ appeared to be actually controlling the migration and routing of the monocytes and were therefore pivotal to the health of the human organism.  Pert argues that this finding demonstrated the scientific connection behind stress and a weakened immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In Pert’s view, the discovery of neuropeptides was a major breakthrough towards the understanding that the body and mind are one.  If the mind under the old scientific model is defined by brain-cell communication through neuropeptides and their receptors, then this can now be naturally extended to include the entire body.  Since neuropeptides and their receptors are in the body then science can now say that the mind is the body, or there exists one “body-mind”.  The ‘molecules of emotion’ literally run the physiology and communicate from one cell to another, integrating the systems.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Pert believes that emotional expression is always linked to the flow of peptides in the body which seems to be the physical counterpart of the subtle energy-in-motion.  Pert says the emotions and peptides are in two way communication.  An example of emotions affecting peptides is the action of blushing - the thought and emotion comes first and then the peptides follow, causing the blood vessels in the face to expand.  The release of endorphins in the body causing pain relief and euphoria is an example of peptides affecting emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>From this viewpoint, expression of all the emotions is a healthy way to live as it lets the subtle energy and its physical counterpart, the peptides, flow freely around the network of communication in the body, maintaining homeostasis.  It can be thus argued that it is the chronic suppression of emotions that energetically results in a disturbance of the flow of subtle energy, through the chakras, into the body.  The physical result is an insufficient flow of peptides and a disturbance of function at the cellular level, setting up a weakened condition of the organism that can lead to disease.<sup>14</sup><sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Kissen and Eysenck (1962) carried out research into personality differences in male lung cancer patients.  The research looked into the connection between lung cancer, cigarette smoking and the repression of emotion.  They discovered that smokers who were unable to express emotion were five times as likely to develop cancer and that the greater the repression, the less amount of cigarette smoking required to be at the risk of cancer.<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Another similar study was carried out in the former Yugoslavian industrial town of Crvenka over a ten year period.  In this study Grossarth-Maticek et al. (1985) utilized what they called rationality and antiemotionality (R/A), a factor related to the suppression of aggression.  The researchers used a questionnaire of 109 questions.  It was found that in the group of smokers who answered the 11 questions relating to a high level of suppression of aggression in the affirmative, the level of cancer was 40 times higher.  Conversely, it was found that no smokers had any incidence of cancer unless they had R/A scores of 10 or 11.  The researchers suggested that smoking alone is not sufficient to cause cancer and suppression of emotions is an important factor in disease.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Further research found that trauma and blockage of emotional information can be stored indefinitely at the cellular level.<sup>14</sup>  An example of this is the proposed link between early childhood emotional trauma and subsequent cancer.  Harris (2006) has compiled evidence which argues that trauma before the age of seven is an important factor in the aetiology of cancer.<sup>19</sup> Almost every other culture but ours recognises the role played by some kind of emotional energy release in healing.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"intermediate-section-7\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-2\">\r\n            <h3>WIDENING OUR PERSPECTVE ON ESSENCES</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>To work with the energy bodies discussed above we need to know how to recognise when they have become distorted. We can notice this by a change in our emotional and psychological behaviour and patterns.<sup>20</sup> Emotions are energy-in-motion and to work with these underlying energies we can use medicines that are vibrational/energetic in nature.<sup>15</sup> Flower essences are one such body of medicine. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>We have already discussed essences in the Beginner section, but now with our new found understanding of human multidimensional anatomy, we can begin to look deeper into essences.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The following is fantastic article<sup>21</sup> by Peter Tadd, a clairvoyant that has worked as “quality control” for several flower essence producers.

Don, the director of the International Flower Essence Repertoire (IFER), presented me with a number of bottles of flower essences to analyse. Flower essences are not like essential oils; they are 'merely' energetic patterns of flowers held in water and alcohol. I instantly discovered that I could align myself to the vibrational frequencies of flower essences made by various people from around the world. Like many individuals who choose alternative medicine as a primary protocol, my wife, family and I had used the Bach flower remedies for years, but this was the first time that I had used my clairvoyant abilities to 'read' an essence directly. I and my 'third eye' have become a 'quality control department', analysing essence line consistency and assessing new candidate flower essence lines.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>My profession as a healer and therapist centres around my clairvoyant skills. I can see the aura and chakra system of humans, animals, plants, and even standing stones. This innate ability has been refined from childhood over the years. It also applies to my experiences in nature. On the subtle or etheric levels, I see beings in the landscape, in trees and in the smallest flowers. Without getting into a complex description of nature's hierarchy, one can simply imagine that we are surrounded by the constant presence of etheric intelligences. The more natural and undisturbed the spot, the 'higher the energy', the greater the number and the more complex the orchestration of these luminous beings. Some of the most powerful places are in England, which reflects a culture in love with plants and the land. Yet most of us are veiled from this perception due to our overly rational minds, which are occupied with the limits of the world of physical sense. The fact that invisible beings cohabit with us is no less real than the fact that we are constantly being bombarded by images of and information in invisible wavelengths from television, radio and microwave frequencies that we do not perceive directly. The etheric realm can be contacted by our peripheral vision and our own etheric bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>Sensitive people have expanded etheric fields. They unintentionally receive information from their environment. The experience of nature reaching out to us is a central theme in the lives of many of the flower essence makers. Ian White, developer of the Australian Bush Flower Essences, for example, while on a walk was stopped dead in his tracks two years ago by a plant of Sydney Rose, which demanded that an essence be made of it immediately. Sandra Epstein, of the Araretama Rainforest Essences of Brazil was informed by a type of lichen, which produced an essence called Moara; Tanmaya of the Himalayan Flower Enhancers had never heard of the Bach remedies, and thought he had 'lost it' while trekking in the Himalayas as flowers began to 'speak', instructing him how to make flower essences. What I have discovered in my teaching is that one very real way to learn how to 're-attune to the invisible intelligences in nature', who are constantly reaching out to us, is by taking flower essences. Turn off the cell phone, shut down the laptop and tune in to the real ethernet.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h5>Ethernet.ess</h5>\r\n              <p>In order to understand the way flower essences interact with us we have to define what is ether – what are its properties and functions. Ether is the bridge between the physical world and all other dimensions of the self – emotional, mental and spiritual. The etheric body appears as a self-luminous, holographic, three-dimensional, monochromatic, laser-like silhouette of light. Ether is harmonious, interactive and equi-polarized. It can appear as any colour of the light spectrum, but primarily appears as whitish yellow or whitish blue. Yellow colour tones indicate set patterns and are a means to access memories, and bluish colours reveal our new or future potentials. These etheric spatial forms are alive and intelligent. In humans, physical ether is found just under skin and highly concentrated in the iris of the eyes and the palms of the hands. It is the energetic structural basis of the acupuncture meridian system and the seven major embodied chakras, as well as numerous minor chakras.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>Physical ethers support cellular structure in every kingdom from the mineral, plant and animal to ourselves. For example, 'an etheric leaf', which can be captured by Kirlian photography, provides the blueprint for the actual leaf as it develops each spring. If you mark the branch of that leaf and save the leaf, you will discover that an identical one will appear each year. The physical etheric leaf holds its pattern. Ether substrates our physical reality. These etheric forces can be labelled evolutionary, meaning that they maintain the pattern of biological history. It is the etheric forces that make herbal remedies more effective than their pharmaceutically-synthesized counterparts. What remains of a high potency homeopathic remedy when all of the actual material has been diluted beyond any trace? Simply ether.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>Ether can be damaged by radiation, as found in cases of leukaemia in children living downstream from nuclear power plants, electro-magnetism again creating leukaemia in children living too close to electrical power lines, and industrial chemicals, drugs and tobacco smoke extract the vital prana from the etheric field. Ether is distorted or even destroyed by microwave ovens, thus wrecking the immune system of those who ingest microwaved food, and is also inexorably altered by genetic engineering. In my opinion, ether is the sole medium for epigenetic programming. (see New Scientist for an amazing article on the unseen forces in genome methylation.)[1]</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>What I see is that there are two etheric grids, one on the surface of the earth and the other in the sky. The earth grid is more closely related to David Bohm's explicate order and the sky grid is the transformer of the deep implicate order. The earth's etheric energies flow through the 'ley lines' and sacred sites. This is mirrored in the blue sky by a grid, which is suspended at an altitude of 2.5 miles. This complementary dimension of etheric energies to the physical etheric is termed 'involutionary', as they are an absolute state of potential realities. These 'sky-like' forces infuse our time-space three-dimensional reality with 'spiritual intensity and expansiveness'. These ethers are activated when we meditate or pray. One function of the throat chakra is to integrate these two etheric grids. This is one reason why flower essences and homeopathics are placed just under the tongue, sublingually. The termination of the conceptual vessel meridian 'downloads' the information of the flower essence directly into our etheric bodies. Blue is a colour that can appear to the mind's eye and indicates an 'up-link' to the higher self. Swami Muktanada often wrote about the blue pearl.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>Some flower essences are 'designed' to connect to the higher self through spiritual ethers to make contact to the transcendental chakras, which are a second and third set of sevens chakras stacked up over the head, looking very southeast Asian pagoda-like. One essence line, Dancing Light Orchid Essences, does just that by \"bringing us back to our original blueprint\", according to the developer Shabd-sangeet Kalsa. Shabd-sangeet Kalsa's silver diamond- like outer aura infuses her essences with a presence that augments the already transcendental frequencies of the orchid range. Orchids are considered to be at the pinnacle of plant evolution. The expansive silver of Shabd-sangeet Kalsa's aura or the golden radiance of Ian White's aura indicate a very powerful alignment with the devas. At IFER all of the 23 lines, a combined total of over 2,500 unique flower essences, maintain various devic attunements.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>What a Difference a Deva Makes</h4>\r\n              <p>The devic aspect of the flower essence is the key to a successful range of essences. The energetic imprint of a flower or plant is simple enough to make; anyone can do it. But to reach into the 'spiritual waters' to invite the devic realm requires an evolved human soul and devic guidance. Whereas yellow white physical ether correlates to the past and the spiritual blue ether to the future, devic ether (which is gold or silver or diamond colour) has no relationship to time whatsoever. Devic presence is all pervasive and overlighting. It is very much like the Taoist immortals, who have attained the wisdom of the ages. Yet for the devas to manifest into our bodies or into trees or in animals they have to work through physical and spiritual ethers. These ethers are utilized as carrier wave forms, which are properly aligned to the earth and to the sky. Carrier waves are any baseline directed forces that can transport a second set of wave frequencies. The devic manifests through these two primary etheric wave forms of the past and the potential. In doing so, the devas 'want us to see the bigger picture', which has to do with our own deeper spiritual identity and the essential involvement of that awareness in everyday life. In fact the devic resides in an interior aspect of the heart chakra. The Tibetan Buddhists refer to this as \"the undefilable self\".[2] Swami Sri Yukteswar, the mentor of Parmahansa Yogananda, termed it Devata.[3] Deva is the Sanskrit root of divine. Deva is divine presence.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>The Quality Control Department</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>In my procedure in analysing flower essences, I hold a bottle and then look at its aura. This allows me to feel the developer's state of mind and at times the method of making. Then I take that dropper or pipette out. It is here that I make a deeper connection to the actual flower essence. What appear to my mind's eye are often very bright intense colours of blues, whites, pinks, golds and purples. In some instances there are actually miniaturized spirit beings even within the dropper itself or just surrounding it. Sometimes there are explosions of colour like a huge firework display, reduced to a cubic centimetre. Then the intelligence of this essence will inform me as to the use and the purpose of the essence. This is the procedure that I have created to analyse essences for some of the major developers in the world. While employed by Ian White of the Australian Bush Flower Essences range I discovered that one of his 62 essences, Yellow Cowslip Orchid did not contain his personal signature. Ian's essence line is very powerful due to a number of factors, which include his own connection to the devic realm as well as the pristine environment of Australia. When I received feedback from Ian, he mentioned that indeed this was the one essence that he did not personally create due to the fact that it was created by a group of 60 students on a workshop with him in Australia. He has since remade that mother tincture on his own.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>One of my discoveries in the German B&B was an essence that displayed musical tones. Each time I lifted the dropper out of the bottle there was not only light but sound. Don later informed me that indeed Lila Devi who created the Master Flower Essence line sings to the essences while they are forming. A year later whilst analysing the Dancing Light Flower Essence line I was immediately brought to a newer state of awareness, that of a direct relationship to the higher or transcendental chakras. Initially, I felt that these essences should only be used by those who seriously followed a spiritual path. And in fact they are marvellous for those who have developed strong intuitive or clairvoyant abilities and for those needing higher attunement or clearing.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>In each essence there are a number of influences which are recorded at the time of its preparation: the flower, the location, the time of day and of year, and the intention and state of mind of the developer. Even after an essence is made the developer remains mysteriously connected to his or her essences. Should their ability to commune with the devic realm become confused or weakened due to personal circumstances, this change in the developer affects the quality of all the essences they have made, no matter where their bottles are.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>The greater the devic presence, the more in-depth and profound the essence. There are some essences made from plants which themselves are devic beings. Unfortunately, like in all industries, there are those who seek to influence the market by trying to 'enhance' their product lines. Under this guise, essences are activated by pyramids or electronic machines or aligned to other cosmic sources of energy to give them a 'buzz'. This rarely works for long-term solutions. Do you like your espresso with two or four spoons of sugar?</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>The Delicate Intricacy of Being</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>Flower essences are made from flowers that are at their peak of bloom. (Occasionally essences are created when the plant is in bud.) The traditional manner to create what is called the mother essence was established by Dr Edward Bach. He floated flower petals in water under a full sun whose rays infused the water with the essence of that plant's flowers. This practice has been abandoned by some developers who pour water over the blossoms into a bowl. In this way the flowers remain on the plant, and the devas are said to remain happy. Both procedures work; the significant element is respect. The flower essence ranges that I have analysed vary greatly as to the strengths and effectiveness. Strength doesn't always mean effectiveness. We could say some flower essence lines are more masculine or 'yang' while others are more feminine and refined or 'yin'. In choosing essences for my clients I will sometimes create combinations of different lines with yin and yang or essences from both southern and northern hemispheres. What is obviously true is that flowers from different parts of the world and some species are very powerful. And when flowers are in bloom they are at the peak of the plant's life cycle. For orchids the experience of being in bloom is like an orgasm that goes on non-stop for as long as two months. (If you want to know more about orchids please read Orchid Fever by Eric Hansen.)[4]</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>Without wanting to create a picture that is too complicated or convoluted, flower essence making simply requires a growing sensitivity. One needs to pay attention to the subtleties that provide a level of interaction from the developmental stages to its use. It is almost as if mother nature is having fun with us, demanding our full attention to the moment and to the delicate yet essential forces within nature. There are no formula approaches to this process. It is very difficult for the educated Westerner not to want to formulate an on-demand response to better ourselves and our health and personal lives. This rational approach often oversimplifies and even skeletonizes our relationship with life. All flower essences are Taoist by nature.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>The Importance of Being Cheeky</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>As an example of the intricacy and uniqueness of the moment and attunement involved in this process I offer an example of making a flower essences with Don Dennis. One evening after a lecture Don introduced me to an orchid known as Phragmipedium Hanne Popow. He was excited because he had actually heard this flower 'speak' to him, requesting that an essence be made. He resisted this idea feeling that he was in the business of distributing essences and not making them. But it was Don's heartfelt connection with the plant that had given rise to the request. When I was shown the plant I got the clear impression it wanted the essence to be made that very evening. Making an essence at night, of course, goes against the standard procedure. I felt that the early morning rays of the summer sun through an eastern exposure would somehow be more than adequate. We proceeded by placing a glass bowl of water underneath the long spike full of buds and one opened flower. In the morning, at about 9.00 am, we discovered that a new bud had opened and this new blossom was now touching, as it were, cheek to cheek with the first flower. This gesture of opening and making contact became the central theme of this flower essence, which we named 'Unveiling Affection'. When taking this flower essence people feel the emotional aspect of the heart chakra opening, a sense of being nurtured and at home with oneself, and open to others at the same time – a great salve for those suffering from a history of unhappy intimate relationships and fearing only 'more of the same' and lost in a sense of personal unworthiness.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>The Nature of Intelligence</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>Don and I poured water from the glass bowl over the two orchid blossoms. The etheric energy of these blooms, which appeared as an amber-coloured mist floating above the bowl, folded into the water. The water was then infused with this energetic presence. Water will hold this encoded template for a month or so. If cognac/brandy is added, the alcohol will preserve the pattern for many years. Water has an ability to absorb and be transformed by ether. The fact that water can hold healing vibrations was known in America in the early 19th century and utilized by a New Englander, Phineus Parkhurst Quimby, who transmitted spiritual healing into water, which he bottled and then posted to clients. In the 1980s The Mobius of Society in Santa Monica, California, ran a number of trials of an experiment using nine different healers. These unrelated individuals transmitted healing 'vibrations' into sealed bottles of water, which were then sent to a laboratory for spectrographic analysis. In this double-blind study, there was a consistency in the degree of change in the spatial relationship of the water molecules. The greater the healing force, the greater the 'space' in between the water molecules. This space is the etheric space, which is the very sense of expansiveness that one has after a good meditation. We 'feel' lighter and, indeed, the water in our bodies is.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>Genies in a Bottle</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>Etheric and devic forces which have an enormous range of application are all contained in wee bottles, like miniaturized genies ready to serve our needs. Their very presence creates an effect. Here is an example. Since I have become more familiar with flower essences, they appear more and more often in the auras of my clients. Now that a few essence lines are in stock in a Swiss clinic in which I work, they are even more present. They make themselves known in a big silent way. Flower essences enter the body/mind, unlike homeopathic remedies. A homeopathic will calibrate one's etheric body to its frequency, whereas flower essences will accommodate to the individual needs by tailoring their interactions. The devic intelligence of the flower essence knows exactly what to do. If you pay attention you can feel just where the essence is travelling. This sensation lasts for 30-60 seconds. Here are some examples.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h5>Radiant Strength; Dancing Light Flower Essences; by SSK Alaska</h5>\r\n\r\n              <p>For 80% of my clients and students an essence will perform in the same way. For example, when taking Radiant Strength one feels a warmth in the centre of the chest. The essence will move directly into the heart chakra at the level of divine presence. One feels confident and centred in self. But if there is a severe blockage in the throat chakra, maintaining deep issues about personal self-esteem, it will focus there. Initially, I was surprised – shocked – by the degree of awareness or consciousness of the flower essences.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h5>Chiton; Pacific Essences; by Sabina Pettitt, Canada</h5>\r\n\r\n              <p>This essence is not from a flower but a sea creature and creates 'gentleness which serves to break up and to dissolve blockages and tension'. A quadriplegic sixteen-year-old immediately began to open her left hand, which was held in a tight fist. Her hand slowly opened over a five-minute period to be completely tension free. This treatment has had to be repeated many times and this hand is improving. This essence stays in the throat and expands the throat chakra to attune to the vastness of the causal field.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h5>Fringed Violet Australian Bush Flower Essence; by Ian White</h5>\r\n\r\n              <p>The best psychic protection around. There is an envelope of the aura, which is made of ether. This is normally underdeveloped, torn, flabby or hardly formed at all. Fringed Violet sends a devic shock wave to reconstruct this essential level of the aura. Great for kids with nightmares, or when very sensitive personality types get overwhelmed by high street shopping, or for those who are generally overly emotionally sensitive.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h5>Golden Radiance; IFER; by Don Dennis and Heather Decam, England</h5>\r\n\r\n              <p>What a honey of an orchid essence. Everyone feels the mind's eye clear and a gentleness pass over the sides of the head. I see an amber coloured etheric ring appear on the forehead of everyone who has tried it. A wonderful way to clear the mind to receive higher instruction.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>Conclusion</h4>\r\n\r\n              <p>My work at IFER continues with Don in ongoing research into flower essence combinations and his passion for orchids and their etheric healing qualities. There are many avenues for exploration and research of these essences. I am very grateful for all the flower essence developers and practitioners whose energy and talents have created an opportunity for all of us to experience and realign to the purity of nature.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>References</h4>\r\n\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>1.

Before we start, please keep an open mind, because this information is going to be EXTREMELY different from what is taught in the West. To REALLY understand health and disease we need to cover a lot of topics, including the nature of reality, because ultimately we need to understand who we are, where we are, and how we create reality. THIS is the medicine of the plants, this is what they teach. This section will not be referenced. These teaching are from direct interaction with the plants and they do not conform to “scientific evidence” i.e. for some of the things I am about to share there exists no evidence within “science” simply because “science” itself, has been formed to suppress this type of knowledge, and focus entirely on the material world. The reasons for this we will get into very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>We need to come to terms with the truth, no matter how “mind bending” it may seem, that what we think of as our everyday reality is NOT the truth of the universe. </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-2 br-10 mt-3 mb-2\">\r\n            <h3>UNDERSTANDING MEDICINE, REALITY, AND HOW THE PLANTS TEACH</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/alberto_icaros.jpg\" alt=\"Shaman perfoming healing\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>I understand that just mentioning that “our everyday Western reality is VERY different to the reality of nature” – is not really very practical to let’s try to make this concept a bit more concrete. To give you a practical understanding of how the plants teach medicine, let’s talk about the process of shamanic apprenticeship in the Amazon. This is the training of the Medicine Man in a tradition that has a history of thousands of years.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>In Amazonian shamanism the apprentice learns medicine through the process of shamanic “dieting”. The following is a description of the process by a master Amazonian Shaman: </p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"quote-block px-1 py-1\">\r\n              <p><i>“Shamanic dieting is the way that shamans in the Amazon apprentice and learn directly from the plant spirits themselves. It is a process that takes the participant out of ordinary reality into an altered state during the duration of the diet where communion of the plant or plants that are being dieted takes place. The plants are ingested in an infusion typically like a tea with water on the first night of the diet. Depending on the individual the plants will only be ingested that first time or on subsequent nights. The majority of the plants have little visionary effects and the learning takes place through the dream space, but often the dreams themselves seem little different than your normal course of dreaming. At first, the shamans\r\n              say the learning process is invisible but then as you progress and learn to see more, the vibrant spiritual process is not only noticed but lived in the present time. You reach the point of working with the spirits you are dieting directly in this reality and many others.</i></p>\r\n\r\n              <p><i>The diets are considered the pinicle of intensity for the apprentice. It is through pure intent that one completes the diet and bonds with the doctor spirit of the plant. Through that bond, the spiritual knowledge and healing abilities are passed.”</i></p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/plant_diet.jpg\" alt=\"Plant diet preparation\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>During the shamanic diets our whole concept of reality is broken down and rebuilt. We begin to realize that in the West we are born into an idea of reality that is not based on truth. We have SO many incorrect perceptions of the nature of reality and these misconceptions are passed down from parent to child in a never ending loop. We all “agree” on these misconceptions, and this further cements these falsities in the collective consciousness of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>As soon as a Western apprentice undergoes the process of shamanic initiation, the plants start the task of breaking down these false perceptions that we have erroneously formed since birth, and rebuilding them back up with the truth of nature.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Up until this moment, we could have spent most of our life believing in a understanding of life that is simply not true, but because it’s the only thing we have ever known and everyone else also has this false understanding then we BELIEVE this to be true...but it simply isn’t.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>So the process of healing, is really breaking down all these misconceptions and replacing them with truths.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"advanced-section-2\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n        \r\n          <div className=\"bg-secondary py-2 px-2 mt-3 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>GOING DEEPER</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/deeper.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Amaringo Ayahuasca Painting\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>Once we understand that the body is not just a machine, and that our mind, emotions and spirit have an effect on the physical body then to further our knowledge we have to take the next step in our understanding of life. As we continue to take the medicine and the plants continue to teach us, our consciousness increases to higher frequencies and our perspective on life is widened dramatically. We then get into deeper levels of medicine which encompasses far more than just physical medicines for our body. What I mean by this is that our understanding of medicine changes, and we realise that medicine is a synonym for TRUTH. Our quest for knowledge moves away from healing the symptoms of disease and towards the nature of life itself.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>As our consciousness expands we begin to see that the world is absolutely NOT as we thought it was, and here is where we get into what most people term “conspiracy theories”. This is a delicate subject, especially in the times we are now living, as this information is hotly debated on social media, and is currently being censored in an extreme way.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Unfortunately the simple fact is that we live in a highly manipulated version of reality, one which is far from the nature of reality taught by the plants, and understood by the Medicine Man. The manipulators in this scenario label any talk of this manipulation as “conspiracy theories” and censor any talk of the real nature of reality. There is a reason that powerful shamanic teacher plants such as Ayahuasca, Peyote, San Pedro, Teacher Mushrooms are made illegal in the West. It’s because the manipulators don’t want people to understand the truth of life and their true power. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>CAUTION: You don’t need to take the upcoming information as your truth. If you dismiss any talk of human manipulation as “conspiracy theories” and this information doesn’t resonate with you then please just don’t read anymore or watch the videos. That’s absolutely OK! Stop here with what you have learnt in the beginner and intermediate sections, and have fun taking the essence and experiencing a beautiful healing journey!</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>...If you are still here, then please understand that I have made this education section of the website with the full intent of sharing EVERYTHING that the plants have directly taught me about medicine, or sources of information that I have been led to, and this DEFINITELY includes those subjects that are termed “conspiracy theories” - but this is my truth and this is the truth that I will share, because it’s the only one I can. As mentioned previously the majority of this information can NOT be backed up by “scientific evidence” because the majority of science ONLY measures the material world. I’m not going to beat around the bush, I’m just gonna go all out and say it like it is, and then provide you with additional resources for further reading. I truly hope this helps widen your consciousness and brings more medicine into your life!</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"py-2 mt-3\">\r\n          <h3>WHO ARE WE AND WHERE ARE WE?</h3>\r\n\r\n          <p>As many shamans and mystics have said over the thousands of years of recorded history - We are all that exists. We are infinite consciousness having an experience as human. This is what the plants teach. Everything is energy, everything in the universe is connected, we are all ONE consciousness.</p>\r\n            \r\n          <p>Right now, we are all participating in the “Earth Experiment”, which was an experiment to experience the transformation of consciousness/frequency inside a physical form. From a 3rd dimensional frequency, to a 5th dimensional frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>This video by Lorie Ladd is the best explanation I have ever heard:</p>\r\n\r\n          {/* <iframe width=\"918\" height=\"567\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/foz7Qh_bkDA \" title=\"Reptilians Video\"></iframe> */}\r\n          <div className=\"video-container\">\r\n            <iframe width=\"918\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UbxAVAfM41w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-3\">\r\n            <h3>WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE PLANET RIGHT NOW?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>As I previously mentioned, humanity has been manipulated. We need to understand this so we can expand our consiousness and begin to see what we have been living in. From this perspective we can break free of our old version of reality, which includes our manipulated version of health and disease.</p> \r\n            \r\n            <p>This is information is highly contraversial, and I could have easily left it out of this section, but to truly understand who we are and what is going on, then we have to fully understand our situation, no matter how bizarre it may seem. The truth truly is stranger than fiction.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>From a healthcare perspective it is crucial to understand the manipulation of humanity because it answers so many questions as to why we have our current healthcare system. We begin to see that human's working on behalf on the manipulators through secret societies, have sought to infiltrate and shape all aspects of western society for their malevolent ends. We begin to understand why families such as the Rockefellers, purposely manipulated the health system in the West. Without the understanding of their true purpose we would be left pondering the motive behind such actions, and we would not have a expanded perspective on why \"science\" exists, why we have a \"body = machine\" paradigm, and why traditional remedies and all knowledge of human multidimensional anatomy is suppressed in mainstream healthcare, through \"lack of scientific evidence\".</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The truth is, for the past 2000 or so years humanity has been manipulated by a extraterrestrial race known as the Reptilians. They have been given many names and have been mentioned numerous times in ancient texts, and shamans all over the world talk about this mass deception of humanity. It has also been recently researched and talked about by numerous modern authors. I know this understanding is wildly different than what we have been taught since birth, but we have to understand that there is a HUGE amount of information about the universe e.g. the existence of extraterrestrials, that has been purposely hidden from us by our manipulators, to keep us suppressed in a very narrow perception of life. Powerful spiritual experiences that can be given to us by teacher plants such as Ayahuasca, blow this perceptual bubble, wide open, and we begin to really see way beyond our previous limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>This second video by Lorie, is again a brilliant explanation of what is happening right now:</p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"video-container\">\r\n              <iframe width=\"918\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/foz7Qh_bkDA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"advanced-section-3\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n        \r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary py-3 px-2 br-10 mt-3\">\r\n            <h3>HOW DO WE CREATE OUR REALITY?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/galaxy.jpeg\" alt=\"Galaxy\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>One of the major misconceptions is how we create our reality. WE are infinite consciousness experiencing ourselves. We CHOOSE to have an experience as “human” and we incarnate into a physical form to experience life as an individual point of attention of the “self”. Our body is not solid, is appears solid because of the way the eyes decode waveform information and create a three dimensional hologram of information in our brain. The image of physical reality that we think we see “outside” is actually a holographic projection that is created inside the brain. We actually live a universe made up of energy or waveforms, and our body is pure energy or waveforms, everything is. The eyes decode waveforms into a physical image, which is actually an amazing and a beautiful way of experiencing energy.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>So how is our reality created? The vast majority of spiritual literature points to the “Law of Attraction” which extends the principle of resonance in physics, and says our vibration attracts to it waveforms that are of a matching vibration. We experience whatever our frequency/waveform is in resonance with. However, where the teachings of the plants and the spiritual literature differ is in the understanding of manifestation and “who” controls our vibration.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The law of attraction literature states that our thoughts control our vibration. The plants teach something different however. The literature states that <i>“our”</i> thoughts control <i>“our”</i> vibration – who are they referring to? We would say, well...us. They are referring to me. But who we really are is infinite consciousness (the entire universe), which manifests the self (“I”) and everything else. So it’s not the self/ego/“I” that manifests. Who I really am manifests the Self and everything that \"I\" experience. So the plants say that we ARE creators of our reality, but not at the level of the self or the “I”. So therefore our (the Self's) thoughts DON’T create our reality.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The plants teach that the self /ego does not have any control over what happens in our lives. It was never meant to have any control. It was designed to experience life, but somehow along the way, and probably during the manipulation of our perception by the Reptilians, we self-identified with the ego and because we assumed that the ego is who we are in totality then we also assumed that the ego must have control over our lives through our thoughts and actions. But as our consciousness and perception expands we see the bigger picture that the self is not who we are and is manifested by who we really are, infinite consciousness. “Life is living us, not the other way round”.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The idea that the self creates reality, through thoughts, beliefs, wants and desires is a HUGE misperception and creates a whole host of incorrect thought patterns. This misconception runs deep through human collective consciousness and even people who are spiritually aware still do not fully understand the process, hence why we have so much talk of manifestation and the law of attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>This passage from a fantastic book called “Shedding the Layers” by Mark Flaherty about his experiences with the plant medicine spirits and ayahuasca describes it brilliantly:</p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"quote-block px-1 py-1\">\r\n              <p><i>“I spent so much time thinking life should be different, wishing it were different. My life was made up of regret, blame, guilt, shame, plans, hopes, fears, wants and desires. None of them have any bearing on what will happen. Life is living me, not the other way around. Just like the spirits said, all I have to do is let life flow through me and move in harmony with it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n              <p><i>The knowledge that I’m not the one doing my life is tremendously liberating – all the energy I was exhausting by constantly fleeing from the present moment becomes available to enjoy what is happening, right here, right now. And there’s no better experience than Now – that’s all there is.</i></p>\r\n\r\n              <p><i>Contrary to much of the spiritual literature that I’ve read, I realize the Mark does not create anything. Who I really am, my true nature, is Creation which manifests the Self i.e. Mark, and everything else. Therefore, everything happens just as it is meant to. Consequently, all of us will achieve exactly what we here to achieve. We cannot do otherwise. Which means failure is impossible, and we are always on the right path.\"</i></p>\r\n              \r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <p>Mark mentions a great point which is a tool that I’ve used during my own spiritual learning, which is when you are delving into your thoughts and searching for the truth of life, whenever you find knowledge or a thought that is “tremendously liberating” then this thought will be true. Life is infinite peace, love, joy, happiness – so the thoughts which are the truth are relaxing, uplifting, loving etc. You can use this as a “litmus test” to discern which thoughts and beliefs of life are in resonance with the truth of the universe.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-3\">\r\n            <h3>“IF WE’RE NOT IN CONTROL THEN WHATS THE POINT?”</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>The ego will definitely reject the idea that it’s not in control. This is a problem that comes from living our whole lives self-identifying with the “I”, We gave control to the ego, when in reality it never had any control. We <i>are</i> in control, we <i>do</i> choose what happens in our lives – just not at the level of the ego.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>So, the challenge, and probably the hardest challenge in our evolution, is to once again TRUST ourselves. Most of us would have had a moment early in our lives when we lost trust in ourselves. The problem is that we were programmed from birth to identify with the self, the “I” - “I am me”. Then when something traumatic happened to us that was beyond our control, we totally lost trust in our ability to “let go” and let our lives happen and go with flow. Instead we think that the only way to keep ourselves safe is to control our lives. From then on the ego takes control and we start to plan everything and control everything. But in reality – <i>we never had control</i>. Who we really are, chose the traumatic event as an experience to have, and everything else in our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The “Higher Self” is an aspect of us that incarnated into the physical form. The job of the higher self is to be the bridge between the two aspects of us: the whole and the individual – who we really are as infinite consciousness and the individual point of consciousness experiencing itself as the self. Who we really are as Infinite consciousness at the level of the Higher Self manifests our life and everything that the self “wants” is known by the Higher Self – it IS us.</p>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/trust.jpg\" alt=\"Heart chakra\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>So now we have to learn to LET GO OF CONTROL. Give control back to the Higher Self. TRUST ourselves again (but this time trusting the higher aspect of ourself which actually has control instead of trusting the ego which will fail because it didn’t have control, it was never designed to). This releases the burden from the self, and we can start to enjoy life fully without trying to control what happens. This release of control from the mind (ego) to the heart (higher self / infinite consciousness) is the path of our evolution in human form, right now.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The belief that we (the self, “I”) control our lives, through our thoughts controlling manifestation, brings stress. It brings a burden, it brings worry that we might be in a vibration or thinking thoughts that attract something we don’t want (fear), it also brings desire and wants, and “trying” to attract and manifest what we desire. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>I’m not a fan of religion but the Buddhists may well be right when they say that the key to happiness is the release of wants, desires and attachment. If the truth is that the self doesn’t have any control over manifestation then holding wants and desires is pointless – because they may never happen! They may not be what WE (at a higher level) chose to experience (as the self) in this lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Holding onto attachment of what we want to achieve in life or what we want to experience, only brings us out of the present moment and focuses our energy on the “future”. As the plants taught Mark, Life is living us, not the other way around. Who we really are, as infinite consciousness, is having the experience as us. So it makes sense that who we really are chooses the experiences. And as Mark says, this knowledge is “tremendously liberating”. We can finally LET GO of control, the self has no control, it never did. We can enjoy the present moment fully, without having to think about the future, plan the future or worry about the future EVER. It’s a pointless activity because we have NO control over it, we can just relax, let go and enjoy life, because there is nothing else we (the self) can do!</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>To fully let go of control we need to come to the realization that EVERYTHING that happens to us is PERFECT.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Worry comes from the misunderstanding of this exact point. We worry (project fear into the future) that something will happen that we don’t “want” to happen – be in reality, whatever happens to us is PERFECT to lead us exactly where we need to go.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>As you can see, this misunderstanding of the nature of reality, and consequently how manifestation works, leads to the negative thought of worry. As we shall see below, all negative thoughts are the consequence of an incorrect perception of the universe.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"advanced-section-4\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"bg-secondary py-2 px-2 mt-3 br-10\">\r\n            <h3>WHY DO WE HAVE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/alberto.jpg\" alt=\"Maestro Alberto Torres Davilla\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>All negative thoughts come from an incorrect perception of reality. The Amazonian shamans observe these thoughts and beliefs in the body as “crossed energy”. The process of “healing” then, is the “straightening” of this energy.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>This is the physical representation of transformation of the emotional or mental bodies. In other words, the physical straightening of the energy corresponds to the changing of thought patterns and beliefs from “crossed” or incorrect perceptions of the universe, to correct perceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The medicine spirits teach us about the true nature of reality and in doing so they dissolve any misconception which leads to dissolution of negative thought patterns and beliefs, \"straightening\" our energy.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Remember, the experience of negative thoughts and the transformation to a true understanding of reality was just a choice that we chose to experience as an individual point of attention of infinite consciousness. Ultimately, we don’t need to “get” understanding or be “healed” because we, as everything that exists, are already healed and have infinite awareness. So we chose to experience healing, for the experience of healing.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>When you understand the truth of life then you can start to see that all negative thoughts were the consequence of erroneous beliefs that you acquired during your lifetime. Let us go deeper into some of the most common negative thoughts and we will see how they are the result of a misunderstanding or a narrow perception of the nature of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div id=\"emotions\">\r\n            \r\n              <h4>FEAR</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>an unpleasant emotion or thought that you have when you are frightened or worried by something dangerous, painful, or bad that is happening or might happen</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>As we begin to understand that everything that happens is perfect, then nothing can happen that is “bad”. When we understand that we are infinite consciousness, we NEVER die, who we really are can NEVER be harmed – then there is never any reason to fear ANYTHING including death. It is all just experience. Fear is a result of our incorrect perception of our true nature.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>WORRY</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>to think about problems or unpleasant things that might happen in a way that makes you feel unhappy and frightened</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>Worry as we have already mentioned, comes from the misunderstanding that there are events that can happen to us that are not perfect. The truth is that everything that happens to us is meant to be and IS perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>There is no resistance to creation at the highest level because we are infinite consciousness and the entire universe IS us – we are ALL THAT IS. We do not provide resistance against ourselves! So from this level we chose our individual lives and everything we want to experience as an individual point of attention. So the journey is chosen and the self created to experience the journey with no knowledge of the upcoming journey! This is what makes it an authentic experience. We couldn’t have this same experience if the self was aware of all future events that have already been chosen by us at a higher level. Time does not exist outside of our minds, so past, present and future are all one, and future events have been chosen.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>I know that all events being “predetermined” is no fun for the self, because it likes to be in control. The truth is WE are in control, we do create our own reality, we can manifest ANYTHING we want, just not at the level of the self. Also events aren’t really predetermined because time is an illusion, so all events are chosen by us, but can only ever be chosen by us in the NOW as the now is all that exists!</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>So why worry? The self isn’t meant to have control, it’s meant to experience. We have over identified with the Self and it’s caused a lot of false conceptions about the nature of reality. The universe is perfect and everything happens in a perfect way. It cannot be any other way. We cannot go down the “wrong path”, we cannot “fail” to achieve our life’s purpose. We chose what to experience, and we created the self to experience this. So the self just goes along for the ride. As Mark Flaherty says “Life is living me, not the other way around. Just like the spirits said, all I have to do is let life flow through me and move in harmony with it”.</p>\r\n\r\n              <p>You see that worrying is pointless when everything that happens is perfect, and can only ever be perfect. So what is there to worry about when everything that can possibly happen is perfect and is exactly the way it’s meant to be?</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>GUILT</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>a feeling of worry or unhappiness that you have because you have done something wrong, such as causing harm to another person</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>Guilt comes from the perception that we can do something to someone or ourselves that is “wrong” is someway, and that they are a “victim” to our actions. However, with the understanding that we now have, that every event is chosen and manifested by the individual, at the level of the Higher Self, a direct link to who we really are, then we can see that no one can do anything to anyone else that they haven’t already chosen. No one is a victim to our actions, so therefore we have no reason to feel guilty, we can never do anything “wrong”. This leads us onto victim consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>VICTIMHOOD</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>the condition of having been hurt, damaged, or made to suffer, especially when you want people to feel sorry for you because of this or use it as an excuse for something</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>This is the belief that we are a victim to circumstance or the actions of others. As above, this comes from the misconception of the nature of manifestation. At the highest level, WE chose everything we experience, and who we really are manifests the self (“I”) and everything that we experience. So nothing happens to us that we didn’t chose at a higher level. So we are never a “victim” and the whole concept is erroneous.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>SHAME</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>A painful emotion caused by the belief that one is, or is perceived by others to be,       inferior or unworthy of affection or respect because of one's actions, thoughts, circumstances, or experiences.</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>When we realize the true nature of reality, that we are infinite consciousness having an experience as an individual point of attention in a human body, then how can we possibly be “inferior” to anyone or “unworthy of affection or respect”? The mere notion is ridiculous. Everything is ONE, WE ARE ONE. No one is inferior or superior to anyone else because we are ALL ONE. We are the same infinite consciousness, so how can we be inferior or superior to ourselves, we are what we are? It makes zero sense. Also we are INFINITE LOVE. So how can we be “unworthy of affection” when we are infinite love itself! How can we be “unworthy of respect” then the person we are looking to for respect IS us, we are ONE.</p>\r\n\r\n              <h4>ANGER</h4>\r\n\r\n              <i>the feeling people get when something unfair, painful, or bad happens</i>\r\n\r\n              <p>This is linked to victimhood. There are no events that can happen that are “unfair” or “bad”. EVERY event that happens is PERFECT and exactly how it should happen. Anger is a reaction to an incorrect belief of the nature of manifestation and creation of experience. We chose everything that happens to us.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-3\">\r\n\r\n            <h3>FEELING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>As part of our individual human experience in 3D consciousness we have chosen at this time to be born into a highly manipulated human collective consciousness. We have been programmed by a Reptilian consciousness that aims for total enslavement of humanity. We are in the process of awakening from this manipulated perception, to realize the situation that we are in, and to ascend from 3D consciousness to 5D consciousness and dissolve the forces of manipulation.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>So from this perspective, it’s OK that we feel these emotions. It’s OK to feel anger, guilt, fear etc – it’s a consequence of our manipulation. We don’t need to beat ourselves up for feeling these emotions (energy-in-motion). We have a lot of stored and stuck energies in our body that need to be released as part of our ascension. As our consciousness expands and we begin to see the truth of life and that we have made incorrect beliefs about life, then these “crossed” energies begin to straighten, we will release all the blocked and stored energies that corresponded to these incongruences. This is an energetic “purge”, and is a pivotal part of the healing process. We need to purge these stuck low frequency energies to make room for higher frequency energies to enter the body and transform our frequency from a lower state to a higher state, which we know as “healing”.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>We need to feel these emotions as they come up to be released through our bodies energetic system. We don’t want to hold onto these stored up negative emotions any longer. We can feel them, and release them. We also don’t want to fall into the trap of trying to “change” these emotions as they come up, and try to “positively think” our way to a “better emotion”. This just delays the processing of the emotion through the body, and can add to the accumulation of negative emotions in the body, that get stored to be processed at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>We should always fully feel whatever emotion is in our body, it’s just energy passing through our body. We have been programmed since childhood to not fully feel these emotions, with phrases such as “stop crying”. That’s not what we want to do. We NEED to fully feel every emotion so it can move through us and be released. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Eventually, as we release the old stuck emotion, we will begin to feel new occurrences of the negative emotion less frequently.  As our new found perceptions and beliefs will no longer trigger that emotional response in us, because we simply won’t believe that anymore and therefore we won’t respond in that way. For example, we will no longer experience the anger associated with victimhood because we no longer have the belief of victimhood.</p>\r\n\r\n            {/* <p>(MAYBE add clip of lorie/phil video – non-phyical beings – where they discuss trauma, triggers, and the processing of emotions)</p> */}\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section id=\"advanced-section-5\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-primary py-2 px-2 br-10 mt-3\">\r\n\r\n            <h3>WHAT IS HEALING?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>How does all this relate to healing? Well…..who we really are, chooses to experience itself as human and chooses to experience whatever it wishes to experience. We are everything that exists experiencing ourselves, and before incarnation we choose to experience in a human lifetime whatever we wish to experience. This includes disease. Now this may be hard to fathom but from this understanding we realise that we are never a victim. This understanding of manifestation dissolves victim consciousness. How can we be a “victim” to anything if everything that happens in our life has been chosen by us at the highest level of who we are? Answer: we can’t. Like so many other things, victim consciousness is born out of a misconception of the nature of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Ultimately, there is nothing to heal. WE are everything, we are whole. So how can we heal if we are already whole? We choose to experience healing, which is really a choice to experience moving from one frequency (which we call illness) to another frequency (which we call health). That is what we think of as healing. It’s just the movement from a lower frequency to a higher frequency. That’s it. We don’t need to heal, because we are already whole and there is nothing to heal, but we choose to experience the shift in frequency and call it “healing”, just as we choose everything else.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>People will say, I don’t believe it, why would someone choose to be born with an illness, or die as a baby from an illness. From this level of understanding it makes perfect sense though. It’s just an experience. Infinite consciousness decides to experience itself/ourselves as an individual point of attention and so incarnates into a physical form (or incarnates into a higher dimensional consciousness that then partially incarnates into a physical form) and chooses to experience dying very young from an “illness”. It’s a choice, like any other choice, it’s just an experience. We see death as a tragedy because we self-identify with the “I” and the perception of “what I can see is all that exists” and “there is only one life and death is the end”. These beliefs are from a very narrow perception of the nature of reality, and are the outcome of perceptual programming and manipulation by a 4th dimensional Reptilian race.</p>\r\n\r\n            “Healing” is just a choice, it’s just an experience.\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"py-2 mt-3\">\r\n\r\n            <h3>WHAT ABOUT MEDICINE THEN?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/images/ayahuasca.jpg\" alt=\"Ayahuasca cooking over an open fire\" />\r\n\r\n            <p>Ok, so if there is no need to heal anything then why do we need medicine?</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>As part of a human lifetime we can choose to experience a change in frequency, known as healing. Medicine exists so we can experience this change in frequency inside a physical form. They are our partners for this journey. We are everything that exists experiencing itself. If we choose to experience this transformation of consciousness then the medicines aid us in experiencing this. We don’t need to get more knowledge because we are everything that exists including all knowledge! But we can choose to experience an expansion of consciousness for the pure joy and delight of the experience, and we can choose to experience illness and healing, for the range of experience which that journey will give us.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>If we chose to experience “healing”, then the medicine will aid us in expanding our consciousness. The result will be a transformation of our misconceptions of life, and consequently a straightening of our energy and a purge of blocked and stored trauma/emotions that have been blocking our energetic system, and restricting our frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>It not about expanding our consciousness and healing, to get somewhere – there’s nowhere to go because we are already there. We’re not going on a journey to get somewhere, we are going on a journey to <i>experience</i> the journey.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>The best thing about essences, is that even if we don’t understand the whole manifestation process, and we haven’t a clue what we have chosen (at a higher level) to experience in this lifetime – we can be sure that as soon as we start to take essences, we will start shifting our vibration to a higher frequency. This really helps with letting go of control of our lives from the ego. We may not know what’s coming in our life, but if we keep working with the medicine then our frequency can only rise, and we can rest assured that we will only create higher and higher frequency situations in our life or events that will enable us to release lower frequencies from our bodies in order to continue to rise. We won’t go “downhill” or experience lower frequency situations permanently. We will be on an “uphill” expansion of consciousness, and increase in frequency, and that’s a nice feeling!</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n        \r\n        <section id=\"advanced-section-6\" className=\"animate__animated animate__fadeIn\">\r\n          <div className=\"bg-tertiary py-2 px-2 mb-3 br-10\">\r\n\r\n            <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>Life is a miraculous, beautiful, amazing journey!

My journey into medicine began in the Amazonian Rainforest in Peru in 2004. I spent 3 months in Peru experiencing medicine and part of this was the beginning of a traditional apprenticeship into Amazonian plant medicine. This was an life transforming experience working with Ayahuasca and the plant spirits at a relatively early age, and I fully intended to continue my apprenticeship in Peru to completion. However, that was not to be my path!</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>On return to the UK, I spent some time trying to bring what I had learnt into the Western world. I realized that if I wanted to practice plant medicine in the UK, I needed to have some kind of qualification, so I undertook a degree in Herbal Medicine and came out with a first class honours degree – BSc Herbal Medicine in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>During my clinical practice as a student Herbalist I was introduced to the use of flower essences. I began to focus more and more on the spiritual side of plant healing. I wrote my final year dissertation on “Vibrational Medicine in Herbal Clinical Practice”. Vibrational Medicine is a blanket term which includes energy medicines, such as essences, spiritual healing etc.</p> \r\n\r\n          <p>Over the years my herbal practice moved away from herbal preparations of tinctures and dried herbs and towards a focus on essences. I still use tinctures and dried herbs but flower essences became my main plant preparation of choice. I was always searching for the best alternative I could find in the western world for the experience I had with the plant medicines in Peru, and in my opinion essences are the form of plant medicine that mirrors that experience.</p>\r\n          \r\n        <h3>THE CONTINUATION OF AN APPRENTICESHIP</h3>\r\n\r\n          <p>As I look back on the last 10 years of working with essences, I realise that my apprenticeship with the medicine spirits never ended. The method of learning stayed the same, the only thing that changed was the setting and the plant preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Nowadays, I keep a journal of all insights that I have whilst taking an essence.
